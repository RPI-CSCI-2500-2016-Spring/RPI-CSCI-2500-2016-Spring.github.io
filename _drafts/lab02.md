## C loops

Write a program that asks for a positive integer *n* and builds a *triangle* like so:

`What is n? 4`  
`O`  
`OO`  
`OOO`  
`OOOO`  

## Fibonacci numbers

Recall that a Fibonacci number is defined such that *F(n)* is equal to *F(n-1)* + *F(n-2)* given that *F(1)* = *F(2)* = 1.
Write a program that asks for a positive integer *n* and computes the first *n* Fibonacci numbers.

`Please enter a value: 5`  
`fib(1) is 1`  
`fib(2) is 1`  
`fib(3) is 2`  
`fib(4) is 3`  
`fib(5) is 5`

## Grades
Write a grading program that asks for a student's grades.
When a negative value is given, compute and output her average.
Use [this](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/printf/) web page to only print out **two digits** of precision (search for precision).

`Enter the next grade: 92`  
`Enter the next grade: 98`  
`Enter the next grade: 100`  
`Enter the next grade: 93`  
`Enter the next grade: -1`  
`The overall grade is 95.75`
