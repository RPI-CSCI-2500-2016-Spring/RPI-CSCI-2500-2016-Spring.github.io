<a id="Q1"></a>

#### I was reading this and was wondering if the proper way to handle this would be to swap column 2 with column 4, or to swap it with column 0, in the usual sense of the word swap. The description makes it sound more like a leftward shift of the matrix by 2 columns (which is how I implemented it originally), but I wasn't really sure which way we're intended to do it.

Yes.
