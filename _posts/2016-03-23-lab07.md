Lab attendance is *your* responsibility.
*Before you leave this and all future labs you must ensure that your name is on one of the check-in sheets.*
You will no longer be given credit if your name can not be found on one of those sheets.

---------------------------------------

## Basic boolean gates

[lab07.zip][lab07.zip] contains all of the starter template code for constructing your programs.
Implement the functions `and_gate()` and `xor_gate()`.

## Slightly more advanced

Implement the functions `multiplexer()` and `decoder()` to perform the appropriate actions.

## SR latch in software

Implement an SR latch in software.
The [Wikipedia Flip Flop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip-flop_(electronics)#SR_NOR_latch) page contains more detail on SR latches.
