I have been receiving email from many of you indicating that you cannot access your repository.
I sent the class a message on February 3rd instructing everyone to please join the organization for our class but at the moment there are nearly 30 students *not* in our organization.
You can join [here](https://github.com/RPI-CSCI-2500-2016-Spring) (following [these instructions](https://github.com/blog/1868-inviting-people-to-your-organization) if necessary). 
Thank you.
