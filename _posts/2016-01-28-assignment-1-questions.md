#### I was reading this and was wondering if the proper way to handle this would be to swap column 2 with column 4, or to swap it with column 0, in the usual sense of the word swap. The description makes it sound more like a leftward shift of the matrix by 2 columns (which is how I implemented it originally), but I wasn't really sure which way we're intended to do it.

It really doesn't matter.  The point of this assignment is to learn about allocating memory and work with pointers.
The `swap` operation is a nonsensical operation that I made up.
The way it's described doesn't even necessarily preserve the contents of the matrix, but that is not the point of this assignment.
Describe what you are doing in the comments and then code it up.
