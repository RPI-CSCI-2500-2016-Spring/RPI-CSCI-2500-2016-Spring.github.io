#### Should I be using rebase?

You should *never use rebase* unless you are working on a new branch that you created.
As I didn't show you how to do that, I don't expect you to be doing that.
Rebase can potentially change the repository history which is *bad*.
If you are new to git, stick to the following: `add, commit, push, pull`.
I would also recommend sticking with command line git in the terminal as opposed to using a git client to learn it a little better.

#### I know that in the first code assignment we submitted you had asked for our names to be written in the main c file, for this one does it matter whether it goes in the c or the llvm file?

You should put it in the README.md file at the top.
So, for example, mine would be like this:  
`# Assignment 3 - Justin LaPre`  
See [here](https://github.com/RPI-CSCI-2500-2016-Spring/assignment3-laprej) for an example.
