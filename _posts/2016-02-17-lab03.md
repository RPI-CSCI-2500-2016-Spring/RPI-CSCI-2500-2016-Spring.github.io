## Finding your endianness

Download the [endian.c file][endian] to your computer.
Compile it with `clang -Wall endian.c`.
Now pick a three letter word and look up the hexadecimal values in the [ASCII table](http://web.cs.mun.ca/~michael/c/ascii-table.html) (along with the newline character).
Create the proper 4-byte int to create that string.
What is the endianness of your computer???

## Introduction to LLVM virtual assembly

Now we're going to generate the virtual assembly instructions from that file.
You can do this with `clang -Wall -emit-llvm -S endian.c`.
This will generate a file named `endian.ll`.
Repeat part 1 by modifying the `endian.ll` file, but this time make it work for 64 bit values (i.e., 8-bytes worth of data).
You can re-build it from the `endian.ll` file by issuing the command `llvm-as endian.ll`<sup>[1](#llvm)</sup>
You may also need to modify the file to remove any extraneous "metadata" from the bottom of the file.

## Exploring LLVM

Try to add a loop in the `endian.ll` file.
If you can't, you may do it with C although you *must* generate the resulting `.ll` file as above.

<a name="llvm">1</a>: You may need to download the appropriate LLVM programs for this to do this part.
