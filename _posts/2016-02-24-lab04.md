## Simple Loops

Implement a function `i32 @sum(i32 %n)` that sums up all integers from `0` to `%n` using a loop.
For this first task, it is fine to write your code in C and then generate the LLVM assembly:  
`clang -S -emit-llvm loop.c` to generate `loop.ll`.  
For all of the following tasks, try and write them from scratch.

## Fibonacci Numbers

Implement a function `i32 @fib(i32 %n)` that returns the nth Fibonacci function using recursive function calls, but no loops.
Can you optimize this function?

## Greatest Common Denominator

Implement a function `i32 @gcd(i32 %x, i32 %y)` that uses the [Euclidean algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm).
