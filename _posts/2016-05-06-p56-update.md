Please add a short write-up of your OpenMP experience to Assignment 5/6.
I'm curious about:

* Your platform (Cygwin32, Cygwin64, Mac, Linux, other)
* Your compiler (gcc / clang, version)
* Your ultimate speedup
* Any surprises you came across
* Any optimizations you thought would work but did not pan out
* Anything else you might think I would be interested to learn
