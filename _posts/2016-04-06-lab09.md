Lab attendance is *your* responsibility.
*Before you leave this and all future labs you must ensure that your name is on one of the check-in sheets.*
You will no longer be given credit if your name can not be found on one of those sheets.

---------------------------------------

[lab09.zip][lab09.zip] contains all of the starter template code for constructing your programs.

## Cache slot count

Figuring out how many slots or lines exist in your direct-mapped cache is straightforward.
Simply determine how many possible index bit combinations exist.
For example, with two bits we have 00, 01, 10, and 11, or 2<sup>2</sup>.

## Determine the index of a would-be cache entry

Given an address, a starting point for your index, and the ending point of your index, find the appropriate index in a direct-mapped cache.
You may leverage some of your code from the prior lab if you wish.

## Determine the size of a cache line

Given the starting and ending point of your index as well as the block offset bits (BOB), determine the total cache line size in BITS.
