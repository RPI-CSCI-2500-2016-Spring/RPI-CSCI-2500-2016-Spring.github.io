Lab attendance is *your* responsibility.
*Before you leave this and all future labs you must ensure that your name is on one of the check-in sheets.*
You will no longer be given credit if your name can not be found on one of those sheets.

## Matrix Multiply

Download the [lab12.zip][template] code.
Implement the missing [matrix multiplication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_multiplication_algorithm) code.
Edit your Makefile to use your OpenMP-capable compiler and run `make`.
Once you have completed your implementation, you can time your program by using the `time` command like so:
`time ./mult`.

## Insert OpenMP Code

Insert your OpenMP `#pragma`s above the inner-most `for` loop.
Gather timings on your code again.
Was it what you were expecting?

## More OpenMP

Now insert another `#pragma` above the middle `for` loop.
Gather more timings.
What happened? 
What if you remove the `#pragma` from the inner-most `for` loop but leave the middle loop `#pragma` alone?
