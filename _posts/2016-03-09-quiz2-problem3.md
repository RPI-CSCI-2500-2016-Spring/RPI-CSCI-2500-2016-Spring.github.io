On Quiz 2 so many students got problem 3 incorrect that it will be discounted.
If you lost any credit on problem 3, you can turn in Quiz 2 during Friday's lecture and
have that penalty removed.
If you were not penalized for Q2P3, you are eligible for 5 *bonus* points.
Simply send me an email and do **NOT** hand your Quiz 2 back in.
