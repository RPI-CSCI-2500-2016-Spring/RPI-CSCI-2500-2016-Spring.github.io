#### Are we are to just summarize the elements and topics that support our argument, or should we summarize the book as a whole and then outline our argument? Also do we need to recap the details of the FBI vs Apple, or is it assumed that the reader is familiar with those.

You only need to summarize the elements and topics that support your argument.
You can assume the reader is familiar with this particular case.

#### If we are using text from the book is there any citation format that you want us to follow?  Also is 2 pages the limit or can we go over a bit?

Whatever format you want to use is acceptable.  Also, if you go over by a bit that's fine as well.
