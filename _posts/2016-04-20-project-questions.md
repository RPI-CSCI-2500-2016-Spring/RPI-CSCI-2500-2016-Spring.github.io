#### I just wanted to let you know that I had to change the Makefile to compile with the -lm flag to get the project to successfully compile and link (it looks like the man pages for the math functions say to link with -lm).  Not sure if other people are running into this as well but figured it could be helpful.

Thanks for sharing!
