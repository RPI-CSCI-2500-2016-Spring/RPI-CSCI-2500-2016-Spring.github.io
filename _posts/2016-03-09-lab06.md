Lab attendance is *your* responsibility.
*Before you leave this and all future labs you must ensure that your name is on one of the check-in sheets.*
You will no longer be given credit if your name can not be found on one of those sheets.

## One bit adder

The [Wikipedia Adder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adder_(electronics)) page details how to construct an Adder.
[lab06.zip][lab06.zip] contains all of the starter template code for constructing your adder programs.
The `one-bit` directory contains the starter code and `Makefile` for a one-bit adder.
Using the Wikipedia link above, use those formulae for your implementation.

## Draw a two-bit adder

Sketch out a two-bit adder with proper carry in and carry out lines connected up correctly.

## Create a four bit adder by stringing them together

Using both of the above and the starter code from the `rca` directory, construct a four-bit adder.
You can use `for` loops or whatever method you like but you must be able to add two four-bit values.
*Note: pay attention to your loop ordering.  If you ask for values starting from zero, you probably want to start your computation with index 3 and propagate it forward.*
